## Overview

This guide explains how to use your custom GLB 3D T-shirt model in the DesignDrip project.

## What You've Added

- **File**: `t_shirt_site.glb` (76MB)
- **Location**: `public/t_shirt_site.glb`
- **Component**: `components/GLBShirt.tsx`

## How It Works

### 1. **GLB Model Loading**

The `GLBShirt` component automatically loads your GLB file and attempts to find the main shirt mesh within it.

### 2. **Automatic Mesh Detection**

The component searches for common mesh names in your GLB file:

- `T_Shirt`, `t_shirt`, `shirt`, `Shirt`
- `TShirt`, `tshirt`, `Body`, `body`
- `Mesh`, `mesh`, `Object`, `object`
- `t_shirt_site` (your specific file name)

### 3. **Texture Application**

When an AI-generated design is created, it's applied as a decal overlay on your 3D model.

## Features

### âœ… **What's Working**

- GLB model loading and rendering
- Automatic mesh detection
- Texture overlay system
- Smooth rotation animation
- Shadow casting and receiving
- Debug information in development mode

### ðŸ”§ **Customization Options**

- **Model Selector**: Switch between GLB, Advanced Three.js, and Spline models
- **Texture Positioning**: Adjust the design placement on the shirt
- **Animation Speed**: Modify rotation speed in the component

## Usage

### **Default Mode**

The GLB model is set as the default 3D shirt model. It will automatically load when you start the app.

### **Switching Models**

Use the model selector dropdown in the top-left corner to switch between:

- **GLB Model (Your File)**: Your custom 3D T-shirt
- **Advanced Three.js**: Built-in Three.js model
- **Spline 3D**: Spline integration (requires setup)

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Model Not Loading**

   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure the GLB file is in the `public` folder
   - Verify the file path in `GLBShirt.tsx`

2. **Mesh Not Found**

   - Check console logs for available mesh names
   - The component will show a red error cube if no mesh is found
   - You may need to rename meshes in your 3D software

3. **Texture Not Applying**
   - Check if the AI generation is working
   - Verify the texture URL is being passed correctly
   - Check browser console for texture loading errors

### **Debug Mode**

In development mode, you'll see:

- Yellow debug cube above the shirt
- Mesh name displayed
- Console logs with model information

## File Structure

```
DesignDrip/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ t_shirt_site.glb          # Your 3D model
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GLBShirt.tsx              # GLB model component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ShirtSelector.tsx         # Model selector
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AdvancedShirt.tsx         # Three.js model
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SplineShirt.tsx           # Spline integration
â””â”€â”€ ShirtCanvas.tsx               # Main canvas wrapper
```

## Performance Notes

### **File Size**

- Your GLB file is 76MB, which is quite large
- Consider optimizing the model for web use:
  - Reduce polygon count
  - Compress textures
  - Use lower LOD (Level of Detail) versions

### **Loading Time**

- Large GLB files may take time to load
- Consider adding a loading indicator
- Implement progressive loading for better UX

## Next Steps

### **Immediate**

1. Test the GLB model in the browser
2. Check console logs for mesh information
3. Verify texture application works

### **Optimization**

1. Reduce GLB file size if possible
2. Test on different devices for performance
3. Add loading states for better UX

### **Advanced Features**

1. Customize texture positioning
2. Add multiple texture layers
3. Implement model animations
4. Add material customization options

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the GLB file structure
3. Test with a simpler GLB file first
4. Check the component logs for debugging information
